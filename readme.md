CSV to jsTree
=============

Generates a tree structure for [jsTree](http://www.jstree.com/) from a CSV file.
Copy the generated data into the HTML to see a result. This is a pragmatic solution for local testing, as a jQuery AJAX request for a .json-file would be blocked.

## How to use

  1. Run script to generate JSON from a CSV
  2. Copy JSON data into HTML to see tree

When running the script, the elements are generated as follows:

    { "id" : {id}, "parent" : {parent}, "text" : {text}}

with a optional `icon = false` if the node is a leaf node.

## Known Bugs
IDs of elements are strictly generated by name at the moment. If you have several nodes with the same names which are not leaf nodes, you might get some problems.
